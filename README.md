### Description

Want to keep your programs free, yet still want a way to make some money off of them? Then support your programs with built-in advertising! This user control can be built in to the program, or in a seperate pop-up window as seen in the screen shot. Ads are seperate from the program, and can be updated easily. Instructions are in the code, all you have to do is edit 2 variables, and your done! For the latest version go to:
